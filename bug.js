This error occurs when you try to use a component from a library that hasn't been properly installed or linked.  It often manifests as a runtime error, not a compile-time error, because the bundler might successfully include the library's code but fail to properly connect it to the native modules.  This commonly happens with third-party libraries that rely on native code, such as those using react-native-camera or react-native-maps.  The error message itself might be quite generic, pointing to a missing module or a failure to find a specific method or component, rather than explicitly stating the linking issue. 

Example (using react-native-camera):

```javascript
import { Camera } from 'react-native-camera';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Camera />
  );
};
```

Running this code might result in an error similar to `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Camera.constants')` even if the `react-native-camera` package is installed.
