The solution involves ensuring the library is correctly linked to the native project.  The specific steps vary depending on the library and the platform (iOS and/or Android).  Most libraries provide detailed instructions in their documentation.  Common steps involve:

1. **Check Library Instructions:** Consult the library's README or documentation for linking instructions. Often, they involve a command-line tool like `react-native link`.
2. **Manual Linking (if needed):** If `react-native link` doesn't work, you might need to manually link the library by following the instructions found in the library's documentation or on the relevant platform's documentation (usually for iOS and/or Android).
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** After linking, clean your project's build caches and rebuild the application. For example, in React Native, you might run `npx react-native clean-project`.
4. **Platform-Specific Steps:** Libraries often need platform-specific configuration (e.g., adding framework or library references in Xcode's project file for iOS or modifying build.gradle files for Android).  The documentation for the specific library should provide such steps.

**Example (using react-native-camera):**  Assume you've already tried `react-native link react-native-camera` without success. You'd then need to look for the specific manual linking steps for iOS and Android in `react-native-camera`'s documentation.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js (Illustrative, the exact linking steps depend on the library)
import { Camera } from 'react-native-camera'; //After Properly Linking the library

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Camera />
  );
};
```
